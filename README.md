## About app design
We designed this game to be suitable and comfortable for children, as we used a light background to be comfortable and not cause disturbance to children with color blindness. We also used kid-friendly cartoon images to grab their attention. We also have written colors to help people with color blindness to distinguish colors.VoiceOver is supported for the game so children can use in an easy way.
