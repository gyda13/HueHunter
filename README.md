## About app design
We designed this game to be suitable and comfortable for children, as we used a light background that not causes disturbance for children with color blindness. We also used kid-friendly cartoon images to grab childrean attention. To help childrean with color blindness distinguish between colors we added the color name for each color. VoiceOver is supported for the game so children can play in an easer way.
